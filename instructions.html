	To become the winner at Sorry, you must be the first player to advance all four  <br> of your pawns from your color Start to your color Home by exact count from the cards. 
 	<br><br>
 	<strong>Game Play:</strong> <br>
Each player begins his or her turn by drawing a card and moving according to <br> the card they draw. To begin a pawn moving forward, you must draw a 1 or 2<br>. It is against the Sorry rules to begin moving with any other card. You <br>may jump over any pawn counting that space as a normal space. If your pawn <br>lands on an occupied space, you bump that pawn back to Start only if that<br> pawn is not your own. When a player has no possible moves available, they <br>simply forfeit their turn. If you can move, you must.<br>
<br>
If you draw a card that makes you move more than two spaces beyond your own <br>Start space, on your next turn you may move into your own Safety Zone <br>without moving all the way around the board. When the all the Sorry card in <br>the deck are used, shuffle and reuse them.<br>
<br>
There are several Slides throughout the Sorry game board. The instructions <br>and rules stated that if at any time you land by exact count on a triangle <br>at the beginning of a Slide that is not your own color, slide ahead to the <br>end and Bump (sending them back to Start) any pawns that are in your way <br>including your own. If you land on a Slide that is the same color as your <br>pawn, don't slide; just stay put on the triangle.<br>
<br>
The Sorry Safety Zones are only used by pawns of the corresponding colors. <br>No pawn may enter its Safety Zone by a backward move; however, a pawn can <br>move backward out of its Safety Zone and on following turns move back into <br>their Zone as the card permits.<br>
<br>
<strong> What do the Sorry cards mean? The follow is a list of the actions<br> associated with each Sorry card during game play:</strong><br>
<strong>1</strong> - Starts a pawn out or moves pawn forward 1 space. <br>
<strong>2</strong>- Starts a pawn out or moves one pawn forward 2 spaces. <br>Whether you move or cannot move, draw again and move accordingly.
<strong>3</strong>- Moves one pawn forward 3 spaces.<br>
<strong>4</strong>- Moves one pawn backwards 4 spaces.<br>
<strong>5</strong> - Moves one pawn forward 5 spaces.<br>
<strong>7</strong>- Moves one pawn forward 7 spaces or can split the forward move between<br> any two pawns. Using this card to start a pawn is against the Sorry rules.<br> The instructions do state that you can part of the 7 to get a pawn Home<br> but that you must be able to use the balance of the move for another pawn.<br>
<strong>8</strong>- Moves one pawn forward 8 spaces.<br>
<strong>10</strong> - Moves one pawn forward 10 spaces or moves one pawn backwards 1 space.<br>
<strong>11</strong> - Moves one pawn forward 11 spaces or switches any one of your pawns <br>with one of any opponent's. You have the option with this card to forfeit <br>your move if you do not want to switch places with someone else or you<br> cannot move forward 11 spaces. Using this card towards any pawn that is<br> not on the open track (Start, Safety Zone or Home) is against the Sorry <br>rules. If while switching with another player landed you on a triangle at<br> the beginning of another player's slide, you may slide to the end!<br>
<strong>12</strong> - Moves one pawn forward 12 spaces.<br>
<strong>SORRY!</strong>- This card allows your to take one pawn from your Start and place <br>it on any space that is occupied by any opponent. This bumps that <br>opponent's pawn back to its Start. If there is no pawn on your Start or<br> no opponent's pawn on any space you can move to, you forfeit your move.<br>
